# **Comparative Analysis of Local LLM Performance vs. ChatGPT**
---

## **1. Executive Summary**
This analysis compares the performance of various locally run LLMs against ChatGPT, focusing on response time, token usage, and output quality. The study identifies key trends in efficiency and effectiveness.

### **Top Performers:**  
‚úÖ **Fastest & Most Efficient Models:**  
- **qwen2.5-coder:latest** *(3.01s, 8 tokens)*  
- **llava:latest** *(3.05s, 9 tokens)*  
- **llama3:latest** *(3.36s, 8 tokens)*  
- **llama3.1:8b** *(3.51s, 8 tokens)*  

### **Underperformers (Slow & Inefficient Models):**  
‚ùå **Slowest & Most Token-Heavy Models:**  
- **openthinker:32b** *(79.0s, 1000 tokens)*  
- **deepseek-r1:32b** *(49.14s, 601 tokens)*  
- **deepseek-r1:14b** *(23.94s, 580 tokens)*  

### **Key Findings:**  
- **Smaller models** (*qwen2.5-coder, llama3, llava*) are **faster and more efficient**.  
- **Large models** (*deepseek-r1:32b, openthinker:32b*) are **significantly slower and consume excessive tokens**.  
- **Models with `<think>` tags** (*deepscaler, openthinker*) generate **redundant internal reasoning**, leading to **higher latency and verbosity**.

## **2. Comparative Analysis**

### **Response Time Trends**
- **Smaller models (7B-14B range)** outperform large models in **simple tasks**.  
- **Larger models** (e.g., *deepseek-r1:32b, openthinker:32b*) exhibit **excessive latency**.  
- **qwen2.5-coder:latest** consistently achieves **the fastest response times (~3s)**.

### **Token Efficiency**
- **Concise models**: *llama3:latest, qwen2.5-coder* use minimal tokens.  
- **Inefficient models**: *openthinker:32b* wastes **hundreds of tokens** on redundant reasoning.  
- **Verbose models**: *deepscaler, deepseek-r1* include `<think>` reasoning, **inflating token usage**.  

### **Quality vs. ChatGPT**
- **Factual questions** (*"What is the capital of France?"*) produced correct answers across all models.  
- **Professional email rewrites** revealed significant differences:  
  - **Best responses**: *codestral:22b, llama3, qwen2.5-coder* (clear, structured, concise).  
  - **Worst responses**: *deepscaler, openthinker* (overcomplicated with excessive reasoning).  

### **Best and Worst Performers**
‚úÖ **Best Overall:** *qwen2.5-coder, llama3:latest, llava:latest* ‚Äì **fast, concise, and accurate**.  
‚ùå **Worst Overall:** *openthinker:32b, deepseek-r1:32b* ‚Äì **slow, excessive token usage, redundant reasoning**.

## **4. Comparison with ChatGPT**
Each LLM‚Äôs performance is compared to ChatGPT in terms of accuracy, coherence, and efficiency.

### **Accuracy & Coherence:**  
- All models correctly identified **Paris** as the capital of France.  
- However, some models (*deepscaler, openthinker*) **overthought simple prompts**, leading to **delays and inefficiency**.  
- Models like *llava, qwen2.5-coder* provided **direct, ChatGPT-like responses**.  

### **Efficiency Difference:**  
- **ChatGPT** is optimized for **speed and token economy**.  
- Large models (*deepseek-r1:32b, openthinker:32b*) had **5-10x longer response times**.  
- Models with `<think>` reasoning took **~20-60s**, whereas ChatGPT would respond in **~2-3s**.  

### **Key Takeaway**
- **qwen2.5-coder** is **closest to ChatGPT** in speed and efficiency.  
- **Large models are impractical for real-time use**, making them **less suitable for simple queries**.

## **5. Conclusion & Recommendations**
### **Which Models to Use?**
‚úÖ **For Fast & Efficient Responses:**  
- *qwen2.5-coder:latest, llava:latest, llama3:latest*  
- Ideal for **general-purpose queries** and **quick, accurate responses**.  

‚úÖ **For Structured Responses (Emails, Reports):**  
- *codestral:22b, llama3:latest*  
- Best for **professional email writing & business tasks**.  

‚ùå **Avoid for Real-Time Use:**  
- *openthinker:32b, deepseek-r1:32b* ‚Äì **Too slow & verbose**.  
- *deepscaler, openthinker* ‚Äì **Too much internal reasoning, inefficient**.  

### **Final Recommendation**
- If **speed and efficiency** are priorities, **qwen2.5-coder** and **llava** are the **best choices**.  
- For **detailed writing tasks**, **codestral:22b and llama3** offer structured, ChatGPT-level output.  
- Large models should only be used for **complex reasoning tasks**, not simple queries.
