# Comparative Analysis of Local LLM Performance (vs. ChatGPT)
*This report has been generated by ChatGPT based on test results collected from 17 locally run Large Language Models (LLMs) using Ollama. The test involved executing a task where each model was asked to rewrite a message into a professional and well-structured email suitable for communication with C-level executives or senior leadership. Key performance metrics, including response duration, token usage, and response quality, were recorded. The collected results were then analyzed and compared against ChatGPT‚Äôs standard in terms of clarity, tone, coherence, and appropriateness for executive communication. The analysis provides a structured evaluation of each model‚Äôs performance, identifying the most effective models for crafting high-quality business emails while balancing efficiency and precision in professional writing.*

## üìå Objective  
This report analyzes the performance of different locally run Large Language Models (LLMs) based on response time, token usage, and overall efficiency. Each model's response is compared with ChatGPT to assess:  
- **Response Similarity**: Clarity, correctness, and completeness.  
- **Efficiency**: Speed and token consumption.
