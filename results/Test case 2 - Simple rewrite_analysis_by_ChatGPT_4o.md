# **Comparative Analysis of Local LLM Performance (vs. ChatGPT)**
*This report has been generated by ChatGPT based on test results collected from 17 locally run Large Language Models (LLMs) using Ollama. The test involved executing a task where each model was asked to rewrite a message into a professional and well-structured email suitable for communication with C-level executives or senior leadership. Key performance metrics, including response duration, token usage, and response quality, were recorded. The collected results were then analyzed and compared against ChatGPT‚Äôs standard in terms of clarity, tone, coherence, and appropriateness for executive communication. The analysis provides a structured evaluation of each model‚Äôs performance, identifying the most effective models for crafting high-quality business emails while balancing efficiency and precision in professional writing.*

## **2. Comparative Analysis**

### **Performance Trends**
- Models like `qwen2.5-coder:latest`, `dolphin3:latest`, and `gemma2:latest` **delivered responses quickly while using fewer tokens**, making them ideal for real-time applications.  
- Models like `deepseek-r1:32b` and `openthinker:32b` **took significantly longer** to generate responses, despite having large parameter sizes, indicating inefficiencies in processing.  
- Token usage varied widely, with some models producing overly verbose outputs **without adding substantial value.**

### **Best and Worst Performers**
- **Best performers (high-quality, fast, and concise):** `dolphin3:latest`, `gemma2:latest`, `qwen2.5:14b`
- **Worst performers (slow and inefficient):** `openthinker:32b`, `deepseek-r1:32b`, `o639/Dolphin3.0-Mistral-24B-Q6_K_L`

### **Efficiency Insights**
- **Fast models with good quality outputs:** These are well-suited for business applications requiring quick turnaround.  
- **Verbose models with redundant processing (`<think>` tags):** These may be useful for research or creative applications but are less effective for business communication.  
- **Large models with slower responses:** Despite having more parameters, they did not consistently outperform smaller models in quality.
